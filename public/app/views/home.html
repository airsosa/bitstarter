    	        Conzultrix Impact is a project that aims to sow the seeds of technological advancement
              through the participation of women and children by empowering them in the fields of
              Computer programming, Design, Engineering, and Business, through mentorship and training.
              This would enable our target develop their critical thinking skills and build their leadership capacity.

	      <h2>What are we planning</h2>
        <p>
          We will be setting up a training facility with two classrooms and a design/prototyping studio.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first class would be set up for children between the ages of 9 to 18 to learn computer programming
          using the Raspberry PI. The device, being a simple board would provide the kids with the thrill of seeing
          the internal mechanics of the computer while using it as a tool to solve real live problems.
          The students would be selected from local secondary schools (mostly public schools) and the
          training would be at no cost to the participants.
          Promising students would be provided with their own Raspberry PI kit for use at home.
      </p>
      <p>
          The second class would be a full scale training facility to cover higher level courses such
          as software development, computer aided design, machine learning, computer aided manufacture,
          tools design, business development, design, and design thinking.
          The goal is to develop a strong technological base that would ultimately drive
          innovation in the society at large. The courses would be taken at a fee;
          however, 2 seats would be reserved for women who would take the classes at no cost.
          Charging for these courses would enable us sustain the free classes for the children.
      </p>
      <p>
          The Design studio would be fitted with work benches and prototyping materials such as
          Lego blocks, clay, foam, foam core, cardboard, and 3D printer.
          Young children from the age of 5 would be allowed to express their natural creativity
          while older students would use the studio to bring their ideas to life.
      </p>


      <h2>Where did the Project come from</h2>
      <p>
          The effect of poverty is palpable on the streets of Nigeria with women and children
          being the most vulnerable. Education has always been a means to liberate the minds and lives
          of the society. However, with poorly equipped public school, undertrained teachers,
          little or no access to books and internet facilities, the average Nigerian child faces a bleak future.
          But we believe in a brighter future and we believe we can make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
          The challenge of providing targeted and relevant education cannot be left to the government alone.
          Besides, government solutions are often met with inefficiencies in implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
          Providing women with relevant skills and experience would enable them create successful
          business from building innovative solution. A popular African say goes:
          If you empower a woman you empower a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
          By exposing children today to computer programming skills, we are building
          a more productive workforce for the future. Programming skills donâ€™t just teach programming,
          they enhance our ability to think about creating solutions.
          Growing up with these critical thinking skills is about the greatest gift
          we can give to these kids and the society at large.
      </p>


      <h2>What is our plan and schedule</h2>
      <p>
          We are looking a 3 year execution period during which we will train 1,000
          secondary school students computer programming using the Raspberry PI.
          The classes would run in batches of 20 students per class.
          At least 100 Raspberry PI devices would be provided to promising students
          to consolidate their learning at home.
      </p>
      <p>
          We also intend to provide free computer programming training to 100
          secondary school teachers while encouraging them to teach their students;
          in science clubs.
      </p>
      <p>
          It is our goal to advocate and provide support for the expansion of the
          current secondary school computer science curriculum to include computer
          programming so as to make critical thinking skills more mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
          Our reach would be broadened by hosting events, seminars, and workshops
          in secondary schools and institutions of higher learning to keep them
          informed on trends to guide them in their career choices.
      </p>
      <p>
          We will be bringing design to the mainstream by providing design trainings from age 5 to adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>
          Internship opportunity would be provided for university students where
          they would be exposed to software development teams and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
          Beyond the 3 year period, we shall sustain the project but without the need for external funding.
          As Conzultrix Impact would be a core part of our corporate value,
          hence our other business interests should adequately provide the necessary funding.
      </p>


      <h2>What is the budget</h2>

      <p>
          We are hoping to raise the equivalent of $55,000 to cover equipments, facilities,
          furnishing, utility, security, insurance, and basic salary for 4 staff for 3 years.
