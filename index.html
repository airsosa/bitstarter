    	        Conzultrix Impact is a project that aims to sow the seeds of technological advancement through the participation of women and children by empowering them in the fields of Computer programming, Design, Engineering, and Business, through mentorship and training. This would enable our target develop their critical thinking skills and build their leadership capacity.

	      <h2>What are we planning to make</h2>
        <p>
We will be setting up a training facility with two classrooms and a design/prototyping studio.
The first class would be set up for children between the ages of 9 to 18 to learn computer programming using the Raspberry PI. The device, being a simple board would provide the kids with the thrill of seeing the internal mechanics of the computer while using it as a tool to solve real live problems. The students would be selected from local secondary schools (mostly public schools) and the training would be at no cost to the participants. Promising students would be provided with their own Raspberry PI kit for use at home.
      </p>
      <p>
The second class would be a full scale training facility to cover higher level courses such as software development, computer aided design, machine learning, computer aided manufacture, tool design, business development, design, and design thinking. The goal is to develop a strong technological base upon that would ultimately drive innovation in the society at large. The courses would be taken at a fee; however, 2 seats would be reserved for women who would take the classes at no cost. Charging for these courses would enable us sustain the free classes for the children.
      </p>
      <p>
The Design studio will be fitted with work benches and prototyping materials such as Lego blocks, clay, foam core, cardboard, and 3D printer. Young children from the age of 5 would be allowed to express their creativity while older students would use the studio to bring their ideas to life.
      </p>


      <h2>Where did the Project come from</h2>
      <p>
The effect of poverty is palpable on the streets of Nigeria and women and children are the most vulnerable in the society. Education has always been a means to liberate the minds and lives of the society. However, with poorly equipped public school, undertrained teachers, little or no access to books and internet, the average Nigeria child faces a bleak future. But we believe in a brighter future and we believe we can make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
The challenge of providing targeted and relevant education cannot be left to the government alone. Besides, government solutions are often met with inefficiencies in implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
Providing women with relevant skills and experience would enable them create successful business from building innovative solution. A popular African say goes: If you empower a woman you empower a nation.
By exposing children today to computer programming skills, we are building a more effective workforce for the future. Programming skills don't just teach programming, they enhance our ability to think about creating solutions. Growing up with these critical thinking skills is about the greatest gift we can give to these kids and the society at large.
      </p>


      <h2>What is our plan and schedule</h2>
      <p>
We are looking a 3 year execution period during which we will train 1,000 secondary school students computer programming using the Raspberry PI. The classes would run in batches of 20 students per class. At least 100 Raspberry PI devices would be provided to promising students to consolidate their learning at home.
      </p>
      <p>
We also intend to provide free computer programming training to 100 secondary school teachers while encouraging them to teach their students; possibly in science clubs.
It is our goal to advocate and provide support for the expansion of the current secondary school computer science curriculum to include computer programming so as to make critical thinking skills more mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
Our reach would be broadened by hosting events, seminars, and workshops at secondary schools and institutions of higher learning to keep them informed on trends to guide them in their career choices.
We will be bringing design to the mainstream by providing design trainings from age 5 to adulthood.
Internship opportunity would be provided for university students where they would they would be exposed to software development teams and methods.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond the 3 year period, we shall sustain the project but without the need for external funding.</p>


      <h2>What is the budget</h2>

      <p>We are hoping to raise the equivalent of $55,000 to cover equipments, facilities, furnishing, utility, security, insurance, and basic salary for 4 staff for 3 years.</p>
